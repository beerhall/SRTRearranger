1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
hi everybody at the Staten Island

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,410
community my name is Don Linden I'm the

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,899
game director for Clara for it seems to

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,059
me that hats pound for had not an easy

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,250
start because there were a lot of maybe

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,559
a little bit disappointed fans of the

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,440
fur art nevertheless the game sold more

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,500
than 1 million copies now how do you see

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,630
this somehow paradoxical point well it's

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:32,520
one of those things where and what I saw

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,440
the dogs were in fact was that you know

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,630
his people some people were angry in the

13
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,989
beginning it still played the game a lot

14
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:41,250
I'd say you have someone complaining

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,410
like oh this game I don't like this game

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,340
you go but you played like 1200 hours of

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:55,649
it say it's a little bit with the

18
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,070
perception right because I really wanted

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,239
to take one more in a different

20
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,690
direction from our country in fact of

21
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,580
all our games that kind of be done by

22
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,159
different people really different as

23
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,760
well so I knew that some people might

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,400
not like the direction I try to balance

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,020
of thanks you know try and make

26
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,380
everybody happy but in the end like we

27
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,540
said in the panel it comes time to make

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,310
it the game that you want this wall

29
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,080
right I don't want to make a game that I

30
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,890
don't totally agree and I fought like

31
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,259
the whole the sort of really narrow

32
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,170
historical thing very micro heavy that

33
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,990
what he was can I'd run its course I

34
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,640
didn't really know how could you prove

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,829
that without say drop him the amount of

36
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:43,110
detail but people who liked at all oh

37
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,689
boy anyway we're doing now well we

38
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,430
didn't know on release was that it was

39
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,229
gonna be really really popular in old

40
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,479
history so if you notice the early stuff

41
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,189
wasn't that as much

42
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,409
oops are adding more more packs in it

43
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,020
that proven to be really really popular

44
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,439
yeah that's point my next point that's

45
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,020
one for seemed to me more to be sandbox

46
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,500
game and now also about alternative

47
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,128
history then I work for two simulation

48
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:14,370
instead was this deep basic game design

49
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,760
decision early on I won't solve to go

50
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,840
that direction but the the game is

51
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,120
designed in a way that it has to sort of

52
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,430
simulation and then I put things like

53
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,870
focus trees to restrict action system to

54
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,360
make it behave where it was like how

55
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,519
free was built around just AI

56
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,620
decision-making they were scripted which

57
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,629
is what Brooks alright this way if

58
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:40,860
something started going on this

59
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,349
treatment I figured this would be a much

60
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:45,450
more flexible way of doing it we still

61
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,099
have some ways to go when it comes to

62
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,769
some of the focuses interacting and we

63
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:50,910
have ways when you start going old

64
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,340
history and it comes from all of the

65
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,660
blocks hitting is almost going to be

66
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,799
some some cases there's something right

67
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:02,400
yeah yeah it's basically in time so I

68
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,959
didn't really know it's gonna pan out so

69
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,670
we didn't put that much effort into it

70
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,680
let me know we're trying Bowser effect

71
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,650
between historical and a circle okay

72
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,099
um in the upcoming patch or did you see

73
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,650
I don't know few who will be introduced

74
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:22,470
you told us here will be yeah as I

75
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,200
talked about in the panel as well

76
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,940
imagine maintaining two games one

77
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,180
without fuel how would I even ask them

78
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,220
possible here starts on the tank right

79
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,680
yeah if the tank is really good but it

80
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,299
requires for you and then you remove the

81
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,590
fuel like what it would have been very

82
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,680
thing for tanks and that was a point a

83
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,470
lot of players who wanted how will this

84
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:48,799
change the gameplay few yeah it will

85
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,209
generally it means that you're gonna

86
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:53,540
need to think about when you use your

87
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,069
use the stuff the users feel right

88
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,310
UK Konami just go like I'm gonna point

89
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,960
down my entire Navy

90
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,150
and will not move it and it's just gonna

91
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,430
all be there because you're not gonna

92
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,780
have the fuel to do that kind of stuff

93
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,700
you can't around the entire Navy even if

94
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,400
you're UK with a lot of resources

95
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,800
overseas and stuff it's not really

96
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,620
practical and we'll see balance wise

97
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,450
America so we'll talk because they've

98
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,230
did the pilot resourcefully will see

99
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,780
we're in the balance wise there for

100
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,850
Japan very much so you don't need to be

101
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,340
smart with the early you're maybe

102
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,140
they're gonna do but to offset because

103
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,390
on these nations now like Germany and

104
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,520
Japan I'm gonna have a little tougher

105
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,950
Mabley I mean they have a pretty tough

106
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,660
time but there are some sneaky things

107
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,660
you can do right to get around it we're

108
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,820
trying to bars that up by changing some

109
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,500
of the other mechanics to kind of

110
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,080
benefit them so I'm making raiding much

111
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,420
harder to stop and much more impactful

112
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,650
and things like that so so even running

113
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,240
a small Navy should be something that

114
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,430
you want to do rather than I feel like

115
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,320
the way you play now is like and their

116
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,900
focus on me there I don't at all you

117
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,910
know so it should be very good battle

118
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,430
back to just have science and it's the

119
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,090
same point with tanks for Germany yeah

120
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,750
so if you look at tanks and stuff the

121
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,610
difference it will do right because now

122
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,670
the way it works is that oh it gets kind

123
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,640
of calculated to you know your your

124
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,760
lifetime of fuel usage it is built into

125
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,040
like the the tanks that you build from

126
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,500
the beginning it creates a little weird

127
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,020
thing that you can't really build tanks

128
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,210
during a period you don't have fuel

129
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,190
where's like after you'll actually be

130
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,100
able to build tanks and then capture a

131
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,110
source of fuel and then start running

132
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,270
and stuff like that so it's gonna be

133
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,060
much more less fragile I think that kind

134
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,820
of stuff so you can still kind of

135
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,380
prepare stuff even if you're temporarily

136
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,360
missing and I'm you manage to get access

137
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,390
I think what it will mean though is that

138
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,720
we can make tanks stronger because we

139
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,490
can own limit how much you can use them

140
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,620
how much effectively in your armor they

141
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,840
are with the current system

142
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,249
right

143
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:09,259
effectively you could have a theory

144
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:12,799
around like a full tank army if we have

145
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:15,799
made them as comparatively good as I

146
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:19,369
kind of wanted but now there's a lot of

147
00:06:19,369 --> 00:06:21,649
an actual limitation which is you need

148
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,839
to have a few and you won't be able to

149
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,479
do it like boy 3 will spotlight infinite

150
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,349
amounts effectively no I mean

151
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:33,739
there wasn't really a cap right so so

152
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:35,659
instead of making it very interesting in

153
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:37,639
my free what it led to was that like

154
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,009
people knew how much they need to just

155
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:42,199
dedicated the time to fill that out and

156
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,610
then it wasn't really a mission to you

157
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,339
anymore we hoped it was still feel like

158
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,829
there's an issue now and even we wanted

159
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:50,689
to feel like everything a big impact on

160
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:52,699
your performance if you really go I

161
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,349
don't want to have to worry about it I'm

162
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:56,360
gonna build you know good luck my

163
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,869
stockpile

164
00:06:56,869 --> 00:06:58,969
mm-hmm so I hope you're gonna get that

165
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:01,129
balance right it's very early days so

166
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,539
like we haven't really played yesterday

167
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:04,219
with this yet so a lot of stuff could

168
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:06,949
change okay can you give us a quick

169
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:10,669
overview of the other main feature of

170
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:13,939
man the guns yep coming to see just a

171
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:16,789
quick yeah yeah so it's gonna be again

172
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:18,759
it's early so I can't say all that much

173
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,149
the focusing heavily on naval warfare

174
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:25,969
you're gonna be able to design ships you

175
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:28,759
can be signing for you know for it to be

176
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:29,989
good of different things ship

177
00:07:29,989 --> 00:07:31,819
composition is gonna be a sort of fleet

178
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,189
compositions gonna be more important you

179
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:36,529
gotta be able to reflect fleet which

180
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:39,319
means that you all ships you can bring

181
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,119
them up it'll be more modern standard

182
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:43,669
this will actually cost you industry so

183
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:46,129
it's not like really repair or anything

184
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:46,639
like that

185
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,729
so it'll be a trade-off like do you just

186
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:51,979
want the big fleet UK probably needs a

187
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:53,150
big fleet because it needs to cover

188
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,150
lower area a more offensive nation

189
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,460
probably will do it like Germany's

190
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,439
quality is going to be more important

191
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:04,849
the quantity for example then we are

192
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:07,370
bringing in some focused really gonna be

193
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,779
focusing on the walkers is a bit from

194
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,490
this and it's too early to talk about

195
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,550
the features that will be there for

196
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,740
democracies but the big poster poster

197
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,340
boy of the expansions America and

198
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,569
they're going to be all test three paths

199
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:24,759
where communists income on the rice

200
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:27,590
there's going to be here a potential for

201
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,120
a second American Civil War against the

202
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,070
South wait like both sides of course you

203
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,570
will find out more on the future but

204
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,610
exactly how the story is found up to it

205
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,250
but but it's possible for them to get

206
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,559
support from abroad the trailer has

207
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,480
actually you know a german cruiser with

208
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,209
aluminum flags now imagine that the

209
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:49,339
germans would benefit from doing kind of

210
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:53,329
supporting this side right okay thanks

211
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:56,240
them for many players i know

212
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,690
the AI is one of the biggest issues of

213
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,880
heart of iron maybe the big problems for

214
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,019
them what are you doing on this front I

215
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:08,540
feel honestly of the way compiler that

216
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,260
with the huge strikes of AI that's when

217
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,209
I really started seeing people like I'm

218
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:15,890
not sure I can do it anymore daylights

219
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,310
beating in the air and starting up

220
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,220
oh man the guns the big focus is gonna

221
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,160
be on naval a I obviously to match the

222
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,470
other stuff because all mostly the name

223
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,449
of AI is really weak and it's not very

224
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:32,120
interesting opponent as some of that is

225
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,459
just because are credibly punishing

226
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:36,860
making mistake in the naval warfare is

227
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,500
you mess up one battle and then you flip

228
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,829
this government but the naval air needs

229
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:45,140
to be be smarter and found an

230
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,590
interesting opponent right

231
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,280
if you can be playing American jealousy

232
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,020
expansion the Pacific world I love

233
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,120
opening all that is really importantly

234
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,980
how you manage your pleats around that

235
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,530
right and for that to be found there is

236
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,000
to be good at it so that's gonna be a

237
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,620
main focus but of course we'd be looking

238
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,600
at you know other boxing stuff as well

239
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,860
one of the things that we've been kind

240
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,070
of wanting to focus on that is gets

241
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,020
brought up a lot is this concept of

242
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,680
suicide attacks okay I will will will

243
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,230
find something that it has failed to to

244
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,730
hold any kind of growing itself down so

245
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,800
that's I think it's an area is gonna

246
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,220
have some improvements because there are

247
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,400
some exploits going on there would you

248
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:39,720
be the stronger it seems to me that

249
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,400
you're working out of problems very

250
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,550
systematically battle plans air war with

251
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,320
men the guns the neighbor warfare yeah

252
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,810
what are the next big points you want to

253
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:54,930
tackle I almost like to see so the

254
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,520
reception isn't the expansion a little

255
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,970
bit before we know if you put it this

256
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,760
way I think politics is one thing that

257
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,870
could do a bit more Allah Akbar instill

258
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,390
doesn't have a spy system either Intel

259
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,630
and all of that is it's very rudimentary

260
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,450
it's based on taxonomy that could be

261
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,220
much deeper and for interesting

262
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,810
integrate in everything there is a

263
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,620
supply the supply system solves the

264
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,760
problem right you can get cut off and

265
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,970
all that stuff it kind of moved out it

266
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,400
simulates the stuff that basically needs

267
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,580
to be simulated but it's not that fun to

268
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,200
interact with you in fact you're very

269
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,200
little interaction

270
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,399
notice really when you're in trouble and

271
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,980
I think ethically succeeded compared to

272
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,950
four three which had a much more

273
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,870
detailed system but not necessarily more

274
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,540
control but it was very very hard on the

275
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,490
stand I think that at least ours is a

276
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,240
little better there but I would like

277
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,639
that system to be something that and you

278
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,750
yourself off the planet you know it's a

279
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,449
real game mechanic well that means you

280
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:14,230
know planning depots building railways I

281
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,870
don't know right it's in the future but

282
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,540
I really want to realize you're planning

283
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,430
your offensive also plan like how's your

284
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,350
logistical operation gonna be handle

285
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,040
this okay for me or to our own it is

286
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,990
again more about the planning rather

287
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,310
than the tactical bouts

288
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,649
so those are generally D'Angelo and I've

289
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:37,240
been pushing them what I must is

290
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,810
something like a memo for ideologies do

291
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,339
you think about that there are my met

292
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:45,130
modes yes I can't stop thinking about

293
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,010
that but it's one of those things that's

294
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,860
been like on the quality of life list or

295
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,110
a super long time but they always go in

296
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,420
there they're always full of it and we

297
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,329
don't have time to put them in but also

298
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:00,820
definitely needs something maybe the

299
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,640
line of force like you can see which map

300
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,949
nodes are gonna be like you know you

301
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:07,360
forget the most important ones being

302
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,980
that you care about the wine is mostly

303
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,070
mostly player not more than one player

304
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,490
yeah so I've received a happening in the

305
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,930
future I can't promise for this

306
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,449
expansion may be many more okay

307
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:25,029
is there a country that is undervalued

308
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:27,399
by the players so we have given a lot of

309
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:31,290
content but which is barely played hmm

310
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,440
it's a good question actually

311
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,959
I think some of them or because they're

312
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:39,829
situational

313
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:42,629
Czechoslovakia actually let's go with

314
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:46,920
France mr France as all the lame trees

315
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,490
it's done please plate all right when I

316
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,709
took two experienced players there was

317
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:54,949
gone at all it's one of my favorites

318
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:57,449
because it has you have a lot of

319
00:13:57,449 --> 00:13:59,220
interesting choices and stuff it's quite

320
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,790
you know it can be quite difficult and I

321
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,800
think a lot of people don't try it

322
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,779
because they do not have this conception

323
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,059
or you know the other strict sense you

324
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:11,279
set up to lose historically or let's not

325
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,309
write mmm

326
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:15,569
it's clearly something that a lot of

327
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:18,269
people like like to play I keep hearing

328
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:19,800
it that's like when they say that the

329
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,170
favorite it's the favorite tree to play

330
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,660
on it when I look at numbers it's at

331
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,069
least played on all the majors okay and

332
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:31,319
what's your personal favorite theater of

333
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:33,389
all right now where do you like to play

334
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:40,589
most I kinda wanna say probably actually

335
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:44,670
Asia of the tiger I think we had a lot

336
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,019
of fun stuff going on there

337
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,379
I hope was the next one it's gonna be

338
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:52,049
the Pacific okay I am personally not a

339
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:53,879
big fan of playing America because I

340
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,230
don't think that I don't have the

341
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,990
patience to get into the world

342
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:03,059
yeah so for me I'm hoping we can give a

343
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:05,009
lot more freedom there if I'm a ball to

344
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:09,990
our trade offs but I'm hoping that the

345
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,029
Pacific worldly fun I've had some fun

346
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:13,769
times and what if they multiplayer and

347
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:15,689
Pacific you were on stuff like that and

348
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:18,619
I kind of really want to tighten up and

349
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:21,420
that's gonna be the future favorite one

350
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,480
mine okay yeah that was it thanks for

351
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,000
this interesting interview
